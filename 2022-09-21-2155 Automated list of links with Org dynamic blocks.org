Backlink: §2020-04-17-1608 Generating a list of links

Org-mode provides Dynamic Blocks, which can programmatically update their contents.

The =zetteldeft-links= dynamic block looks like this:

#+BEGIN: zetteldeft-links :search "#zd-advanced" :sort t
 - §2020-08-29-1223 Automated list of backlinks
 - §2020-04-17-1611 Automated lists of links
 - §2020-04-17-1608 Generating a list of links
 - §2020-04-17-1552 Creating graphs
#+END:

When activated (via =C-c C-c=), the contents between =#+BEGIN:= and =#+END:= will be replaced by a list of links to all notes containing provided search string via =:search "string"=.

Additional options are
 - =:sort t= to sort the results (with most recent note at the top)
 - =:missing-only t= to only include missing links

Use =zetteldeft-org-dblock-insert-links= to create such a dynamic block, or do so via =org-dynamic-block-insert-dblock=.
