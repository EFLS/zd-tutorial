Backlink: ยง2020-05-10-1552 Zetteldeft ID and link concepts

A backlink can be used to refer back to "parent" note, from which the current note branches out.

Use =zetteldeft-backlink-add= (or =C-c d b=) to pick a note.
The function will then include a link at the top of your current note, right below the title.

This backlink is prepended with =zetteldeft-backlink-prefix=, which can be a custom string.

To create a new note and include a backlink to the previous note in one go, use =zetteldeft-new-file-and-backlink= (or =C-c d B=).

If, rather than a single backlink, you want to find all notes linking to the current note, take a look at ยง2020-08-29-1223 Automated list of backlinks.
