A Zettelkasten system has no fixed single hierarchy, but it is often convenient to maintain a base or home note.
Such a note provides structure: it can link to other notes, which in turn gathers links to notes on a specific theme.

In any case, moving to the home note should be easy, which is where =zetteldeft-go-home= comes in, accessible with =C-c d h=.

For this to work, you need to first store a note ID in =zetteldeft-home-id=.
For this knowledge base, we could do the following:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq zetteldeft-home-id "2020-02-15-1247")
#+end_src

As long as you have configured something similar in your =.emacs=, =C-c d h= can be used to quickly return to base.
