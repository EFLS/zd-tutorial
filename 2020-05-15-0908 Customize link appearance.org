Backlink: §2020-05-13-1815 Customizing Zetteldeft HUB

This note is about customizing how links appear.
To customize the format of IDs, see §2020-05-14-1740.

By default, Zetteldeft prepends a =§=-symbol to IDs to create *links* (see §2020-03-30-0928 on the origins of this choice).

To use something other than =§=, configure the =zetteldeft-link-indicator= to any other string.
Change it to an empty string (i.e. =""=) to disable it altogether.

You can also set a =zetteldeft-link-suffix= (empty by default) which will be appended to all inserted links.

This is particularly useful to setup Zetteldeft for Markdown (§2020-04-17-1532).
