Backlink: §2020-04-17-1605 Expansions HUB

The =zetteldeft-insert-list-links= generates a list of links to notes with a specific search term (§2020-04-17-1608).
By providing a notes ID as search string, the resulting list contains all notes linking to that note.

This can be used to generate a list of backlinks.

Building on to an automated list of links (§2020-04-17-1611), we can sort of automate this.

To achieve this, simply provide =(zetteldeft--current-id)= as search term, like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
(efls/zetteldeft-links (zetteldeft--current-id) nil 'silent)
#+END_SRC

 - §2020-04-17-1605 Expansions HUB

With =t= as a second argument, only notes that aren't linked to yet, are included in the list.
